 To develop an enhanced renal imaging and analysis system using CT scans, the work begins with the collection of varied CT scan datasets that include both normal and abnormal renal diseases while sticking to ethical standards.Preprocessing is applied to these images in order to improve image quality, eliminate noise, and establish uniform resolution and orientation.First, the dataset will be partitioned into training, validation, and testing sets. For better performance the test set will be separated into one  folder without labels in order to facilitate improved testing processes. Following that, a deep learning model will be developed, incorporating relevant features for accurate classification and characterisation of kidney disorders. The designed model will be trained on the training dataset iteratively, and regular validation tests against the validation set ensure optimal performance. The model proceeds to testing if the validation accuracy satisfies predefined standards; if not, it is tuned until suitable validation outcomes are obtained. After successful testing, the model will be saved and ready for deployment. Simultaneously, a user-friendly Flask-based UI will be created to enable image processing and visualization.To deploy the model, we must now load it into Flask Server.The integrated interface  of image processing methods and deep learning with Flask-based  UI is ready.Now We are able to implement this image upload process into the UI-based interface, along with validation protocols to ensure the authenticity of the supplied CT scans. After validation, the deployed model will analyze the uploaded photos, and the results will be quickly shown to healthcare professionals through the user interface.
